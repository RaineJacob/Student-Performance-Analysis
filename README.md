# Student-Performance-Analysis📊 Student Performance Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project involves a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of student performance using various factors like family background, study time, internet access, and more. The goal is to identify patterns and correlations that may influence academic success.

📁 Dataset
Source: [Kaggle / UCI Repository]
File Name: StudentPerformanceFactors.csv
Records: ~650 students
Attributes: Categorical and numerical attributes related to demographics, lifestyle, and study behavior.

📌 Objective
Understand the distribution of key student-related variables.

Identify factors impacting academic performance (Final Grade - G3).

Visualize relationships through univariate and bivariate plots.

🔧 Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

📈 Key Steps Performed
✅ Data Cleaning
Checked for missing/null values

Renamed and categorized data types

Correlation heatmap for numerical features

📊 Sample Visuals
Distribution of gender, study time, internet access

Relationship of family status and study time with final grades

Correlation map highlighting academic performance influencers

💡 Insights
Internet access, family support, and study time showed significant influence on final grades.

Students with higher study time had higher academic outcomes.

Students involved in Extracurricular activities perform better than others.

Some demographic features had mild correlation with performance.


📎 Future Work
Build a predictive model to estimate student grades.

Apply feature engineering to improve insights.

Use dashboards (e.g., Power BI or Tableau) for interactive visualization.
